# Predicting Diabetes with Classification Algorithm

## Description
Built a predictive model using classification algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on a diabetes dataset. Applied data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

## Features
- Binary classification: Predict diabetic or non-diabetic
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Feature selection and correlation analysis
- Multiple classifier comparison (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN)
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and AUC
- Visualizations for EDA and model performance

## Dataset
Diabetes prediction dataset from Kaggle:
